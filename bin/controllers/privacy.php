/**
 * The block controller allows users to make use of a permission server to set
 * the permissions whether a certain user should be able to access their profile
 * or not.
 * 
 * The system will generate permission resources like this:
 * 
 * * _profile.{read|interact}.guest: * (global)
 * * _profile.{read|interact}.registered: * (global)
 * * _profile.user.{userid-blocker}.{read|interact}.guest: *
 * * _profile.user.{userid-blocker}.{read|interact}.registered: *(all registered users) | @{user-id} (exceptions)
 * * _profile.user.{userid-blocker}.{read|interact}
 * 
 * This allows the user granular control by allowing them to set permissions on a
 * global scope (app{appid}.profile.read.{userid-blocker}), for guests, or for 
 * individuals.
 * 
 * Depending on whether the user sets their root setting to grant or deny access,
 * the system will use the individual entries as grant lists.
 * 
 * The top level settings would be more akin to privacy settings and should be 
 * placed appropriately.
